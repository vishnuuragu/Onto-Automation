Many organizations, universities, and schools are continuing an online mode of learning or working from home situation to tackle the spreading of the coronavirus. Due to these situations, the user could be using electronic gadgets like laptops for long hours, often without breaks in between. This has eventually affected their mental health. The ViDepBot, Video-Depression-Bot aims in helping the user to maintain their mental health by detecting their depression level early, and taking appropriate actions by faculty/counselors, parents, and friends to help them to come back to normalcy and maintaining a strong mental life. In this work, a system is proposed to determine the depression level from both the facial emotions and chat texts by the user. The FER2013 dataset is trained using deep learning architecture VGG-16 base model with additional layers which acquired an accuracy of around 87% for classifying the live face emotions. Since people tend to post their feelings and thoughts (when feeling down, depressed, or even happy) on social media such as Twitter, the sentiment140 twitter dataset was taken and trained using the machine learning algorithm Bayes theorem which acquired an accuracy of around 80% for classifying the user input texts. The user is monitored through a webcam and the emotions are recognized live. The ViDepBot regularly chats with the user and takes feedback on the mental condition of the user by analyzing the chat texts received. The emotions and chat texts help to find the depression level of the user. After determining the depression level, the ViDepBot framework provides ideal recommendations to improve the users mood. This ViDepBot can be further developed to keep track of each student/subject persons depression level, where they would be physically present in the classrooms, once the pandemic situation subsides.",572,ViDepBot: Assist People to Tackle Depression Due to COVID Using AI Techniques,Conference Paper,0,01-01-2023

In this work, a system that incorporates the determination of depression level from the facial emotions expressed by a student is proposed where he/she could be working in front of electronic gadgets like laptops for long hours, due to the lockdown situation. The FER2013 data is used to train the deep learning architecture, visual geometry group model with 16 layers (VGG-16) base model with some additional layers. The model has been used to classify the emotions and has acquired an accuracy of 87.76% on the FER2013 dataset. The emotions are then recognized live, monitoring the student through a Webcam. The multi-task cascade convolutional neural network (MTCNN) architecture has been used for detecting the face live. The depression level of the student is determined by calculating the depression coefficient. The dominant emotions in a depression state, the negative ones were captured quickly which helped in determining the depression level. Appropriate remedies are then suggested according to the depression level detected, to improve the students mood and also to maintain their mental stability. The calculation of the corresponding depression level in the student will help the faculty, counselor, parents, and friends to take necessary actions to bring the student back to his or her normal mental stage. The system could become more efficient when the activities of the student could be monitored and incorporated into the current system.",479,Depression Level Determination Using Deep Learning to Help Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic Situation,Conference Paper,0,01-01-2023

The changes in illumination,ensued by the presence of cloud and the shadow,aresome of the reasons that lead to ambiguity, while carrying out image segmentation leading to detection of targeted objects. Conventional methods are efficient in detecting thick clouds in contrastive background, but perform poorly in the perception of thin clouds, multiple clouds and their shadows. Reference images for the input are needed in most cases, and separate algorithms are pursued, to identify clouds and shadows in an image, which might not be feasible in all scenarios. Techniques used in this paperto detect cloud and shadows,obviating the need for reference images, are image enhancement, analysis of color histogram of input images, adoption of automatic thresholding and mathematical morphology on the input image. The proposed algorithm,was found to be fast,and experimented on various images that contained multiple white cloud clusters of different shapes, thickness and their shadows. The algorithmwas validated with an accuracy of 94.6% and 87.2% for identification of clouds and shadows, respectively.",8,Cloud and shadow identification from aerial images,Article,1,01-05-2019

Identification of depression at college level is desirable so that it can be controlled by giving better counseling at the starting stage itself. If a counselor identifies depression in a student in the initial stages itself, he can effectively help that student to overcome depression. But among large number of students, it becomes a difficult task for the counselor to keep track of the significant changes that occur in students as a result of depression. But advances in the Image-Processing field have led to the development of effective systems, which prove capable of detecting emotions from facial images, in a much simpler way. Thus, we need an automated system that captures facial images of students and analyze them, for effective detection of depression. In the proposed system, an attempt is being made to make use of the Image processing techniques, to study the frontal face features of college students and predict depression. This system will be trained with facial features of positive and negative facial emotions. To predict depression, a video of the student is captured, from which the face of the student is extracted. Then using Gabor filters, the facial features are extracted. Classification of these facial features is done using SVM classifier. The level of depression is identified by calculating the amount of negative emotions present in the entire video. Based on the level of depression, notification is send to the class advisor, department counselor or university counselor, indicating the students disturbed mental state. The present system works with an accuracy of 64.38%. The paper concludes with the description of an extended architecture using other inputs like academic scores, social content, peer opinions and hostel activities to build a hybrid system for depression detection as future work.",14,A computer vision based image processing system for depression detection among students for counseling,Article,28,01-04-2019

This science is termed as Ayurveda. But, sadly somewhere in the race of keeping up with medicinal science and technology, India as a country has lost its track in the field of Ayurveda. Researchers and medicinal practitioners today, in spite of knowing that allopathic medicines are made using certain plant extracts, are oblivious about the medicinal the properties of plants. This paper aims at eradicating this problem, and hence strives to help potential users make better use of plants with medicinal properties. The dataset consists of 300 images of different types of leaves. The classification of the leaves is done with the help of a decision tree. Our system is an easy to use application which is fast in execution too. The objective of doing this paper is to develop an application for leaf recognition for retrieving the medicinal properties of plants. The recognition of leaves is done by extracting the features of the leaves from the images. The primary stakeholders involved with this project are researchers, medical practitioners and people with a keen interest in botany.

In this case we come to know about the importance of rating and review of the product which impacts the products market value. This article proposes a framework for calculating an accurate rating using customer feedback. In particular, we first take the consumer review as an input then remove all common words by using the information retrieval concepts like stop word removal and stemming. The next step is parts of speech tagging and finding the opinion word extraction to the rest of the phrases. Then we have to match the keywords with the ontology and finally we develop a probabilistic aspect ranking algorithm to rank the product.

This work aims at developing a sputum cytology image analysis system which identifies benign and malignant glandular cells. In our proposed system, we develop an automated lung cancer detection system which segments the cell nuclei and classifies the glandular cells from the given sputum cytology image using a novel scale space catastrophe histogram (SSCH) feature. Catastrophe points occur when pairwise annihilation of extrema and saddle happens in scale space. Unusual nuclear texture shows the presence of malignancy in cells, and SSCH-based texture feature extraction from nuclear region is done. From the input high-resolution image, the cellular regions are localized using maximization of determinant of Hessian, nuclei regions are segmented using K-means clustering, and SSCH features are extracted and classified using support vector machine and color thresholding. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtained an accuracy of 87.53 % which is better than Gabor filter-based gray-level co-occurrence features, local binary pattern, and complex Daubechies wavelet-based features.
