Current diversified expansion techniques either make use of external knowledge sources to explicitly model the various aspects and their relationships underlying the user query or implicitly model query aspects. However these techniques assume query aspects to be independent of each other. We propose a unified framework that produces diversified query expansions in a completely implicit manner while also considering the relationships between query aspects. In particular, the framework identifies query aspects and their relationships by making use of the semantic properties of context phrases that occur within the top-ranked retrieved documents for the supplied user query, and maps them onto a Mutating Markov Chain model to generate a diverse ordering of query aspects. We test our framework against a set of ambiguous and faceted queries used in the NTCIR-12 IMine-2 Task and through an extensive empirical analysis, we show that our framework consistently outperforms existing implicit diversified query expansion algorithms. The utility of our algorithm truly comes up in the second set of experiments where we generate diversified query expansions for a retrieval engine indexing documents from specific scientific domains. Even in such a niche scenario our algorithm consistently provides robust results and performs better than other implicit approaches.",55,An implicit aspect modelling framework for diversity focused query expansion,Article,1,01-10-2020

In the context of the snake game, the goal of this paper is to enhance neuroevolution strategies with better fitness functions for effective goal finding. We develop greedy and non-greedy fitness functions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these functions in both environments with and without dynamic obstacles. We then present an alternate implementation using the NEAT algorithm combined with Novelty Search to increase the genetic diversity of the agent population and explore the problem space without specifying direct objectives. These conclusions suggest that even with a low number of simple inputs, and simple fitness functions, agents are quickly able to achieve a novice amount of expertise in the Snake game using NEAT.",1287,Fitness Function Design for Neuroevolution in Goal-Finding Game Environments,Conference Paper,0,01-01-2020
3,3,"Sundar Darshak,Sendil Siddharth,Subramanian Vasanth,Balasubramanian Vidhya",Journal,2621-2632,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,"Indoor pervasive applications depend on reliable indoor localization solutions. Indoor localization using WiFi is gaining ubiquitous usage owing to its simplicity and inexpensiveness. A conventional method of localization is trilateration, which can be accomplished using signal strength or time of flight of a radio signal between receiver and transmitter. However, trilateration is prone to errors in accuracy that can occur due to various factors. A common reason for the failure of trilateration is due to the errors in distance estimation resulting in a poor quality of trilateration. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted adaptive location estimation (WALE) algorithm. The proposed WALE algorithm provides an accurate localization in comparison to trilateration by taking into account the quality and properties of the circle overlaps. Based on the overlap properties a distance re-estimation and classification of points based on whether they are trilaterable is performed. A maximum likelihood estimation over a weighted grid of this region provides the location estimate. Our experiments over real indoor test-beds have demonstrated that our algorithm provides high accuracies with high stability in comparison to other algorithms. We achieve high accuracies ranging from 1.20 to 2.20 m in majority of the cases and an average of 2.98 m in a large office space with a standard deviation of 1.65.",10,WALE: a weighted adaptive location estimation algorithm,Article,8,01-07-2019

Calibration-free techniques for WiFi signal strength based indoor localization can help make indoor localization systems scalable, cost-effective and easy to deploy. However, distance estimation errors and environmental factors affect the accuracy of non-calibration solutions like trilateration significantly, and addressing the accuracy issue is critical. To help improve accuracy, localization over dual-band WiFi (IEEE 802.11n) which uses both 2.4Â GHz and 5Â GHz bands is a potential alternative. This paper proposes a novel adaptive, weighted trilateration technique that uses the behavior of these two bands under different conditions. An iterative heuristic approach based on the characterization of the behavior of the bands is employed to determine the most likely position of a smart phone. Additionally optimization strategies are applied to improve the time complexity of this approach. Experiments conducted in different indoor environments show that our approach performs better than other non-calibration signal strength based approaches in terms of accuracy, and also reduces the worst case error.",11474 LNCS,A Dynamic Weighted Trilateration Algorithm for Indoor Localization Using Dual-Band WiFi,Conference Paper,8,01-01-2019
5,5,"Dharanitejaswini K,Balasubramanian Vidhya",Journal,186-199,International Journal of Wireless Information Networks,"Localization of assets is a critical component of smart building applications. This problem involves a lot of challenges and gets even more challenging when a consistently high level of accuracy has to be ensured while employing long-range RFID readers. In general, these antennas are placed so that there is some level of overlap of their ranges of influence, in order to support asset tracking with high precision. However, it is desirable to reduce the level of overlap when employing multiple readers for large-scale asset tracking, due to the high cost of these RFID readers and antennas. In such scenarios, it is important to maintain accuracy while increasing the coverage area of the readers, and for this a robust localization algorithm is necessary. This paper describes a novel hybrid indoor localization algorithm that combines the transmission power level control and the signal strength information in an intelligent manner to locate assets accurately. The algorithm does not require much calibration and is easily scalable. Additionally, it allows for both coarse and fine-grained location estimation depending on application requirements. Our experiments in real indoor environments, and with different degrees of overlap between long-range RFID antennas show that our algorithm provides higher accuracy in comparison to other algorithms, and is also consistent.",25,A Scalable and Hybrid Location Estimation Algorithm for Long-Range RFID Systems,Article,2,01-06-2018

Such systems must therefore provide services to support the learning needs of their users. When a retrieval system shows how its documents relate to each other semantically, a user gets the liberty to choose from different material, and direct his/her study in a focused manner. This calls for a model that identifies types of document relationships, that need to address different aspects of learning. This article defines three such types and a unique statistical model that can automatically identify them in technical/scientific documents. The model defines measures to quantify the degree of relatedness based on distinct statistical patterns exhibited by the common terms in a pair of documents. This approach does not strictly require a knowledge base or hypertext for identifying the characteristic relationship between two documents. Such a statistical model can be extended to build further relatedness types and can be used alongside various other techniques in digital library recommendation engines. Our experiments over a large number of technical documents show that our techniques effectively extract the different types of relationships between documents.",48,A statistical approach for modeling inter-document semantic relationships in digital libraries,Article,5,01-06-2017

Comprehensive metadata extraction and support for topic-level search within videos are key factors in developing such systems. In this paper, we propose a multimodal metadata extraction system which extracts an optimal set of keyphrases and topic based segments that effectively summarize the content of a lecture video. The extraction process utilizes features from both audio transcripts and slide content in video streams. A hybrid approach combining a Naive Bayes classifier and a rule-based refiner is used for effective retrieval of the metadata in a lecture. The proposed content-descriptive metadata extraction technique has been evaluated using actual lecture videos from different sources, and our results show that our multimodal approach is effective in summarizing the lectures content, potentially improving the user experience during retrieval and browsing.",46,A multimodal approach for extracting content descriptive metadata from lecture videos,Article,18,01-02-2016

In recent times, IEEE 802.11n is gaining more attention due to the operation of devices in dual band (2.4GHz and 5 GHz) simultaneously. However the utility of dual band in Wi-Fi indoor localization is still a subject of study and has not been widely implemented. The focus of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of using both these bands by comparing their indoor localization performance using fingerprinting techniques in a real indoor environment.

However, the accuracy is limited by the freshness of the radio map, which is used for localization. Over time this radio map might be incompatible due to the changes in signal strength, a consequence of the dynamic nature of the environment. Therefore, repeated radio map calibration becomes a necessity. Currently radio maps are either manually calibrated, use additional infrastructure or complex algorithms to account for the radio map errors. There is therefore a need for a methodology to update the radio map with minimal additional overhead. This paper proposes a crowdsourcing approach which uses data collected from users of the localization system to maintain the freshness of the radio map. This approach leverages inertial sensors present in commonly used handheld devices, like mobile phones and tablets using which, a trajectory of the path of each user is computed. This trajectory is then coupled with the knowledge of the physical map under consideration to get the real time Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values at the reference points (RPs). A novel cluster based RSSI propagation policy is proposed where the real time RSSI values obtained are propagated within the clusters. Extensive experiments of our localization system implemented in a real indoor environment shows that this approach maintains radio map freshness while keeping the cost of update low and without need for extra infrastructure. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",8487 LNCS,A robust approach for maintenance and refactoring of indoor radio maps,Conference Paper,6,01-01-2014
